# Building Your MVP: Top Resources

As a founder, building your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a crucial step in navigating the idea maze and finding product-market fit (PMF). The MVP is the first iteration of your product that allows you to test whether it solves a real problem for your target customers. It often represents a simplified version of your vision that addresses the core value proposition of your startup.

Building an MVP can seem daunting, especially if you're a non-technical founder. But with the right resources and tools, you can streamline the development process and launch your product efficiently. In this article, we'll explore some of the top resources that can help you build your MVP.

## 1. IDEO's Human-Centered Design Toolkit

IDEO's Human-Centered Design Toolkit is a free resource that provides step-by-step guidance on how to address complex problems by focusing on the needs of the end-user. This toolkit includes a range of design templates, tools, and case studies, which can be used to understand user needs, ideate, prototype, and iterate on your product.

Following the Human-Centered Design process can help you develop a deeper understanding of your target customers, which is essential for building an MVP that addresses their needs. The toolkit emphasizes rapid prototyping and iteration, allowing you to quickly test potential solutions and refine your product.

## 2. Customer Development by Steve Blank

Customer Development by Steve Blank is a seminal book that has become the go-to guide for many founders. Blank's approach emphasizes the importance of finding product-market fit before scaling your startup. He argues that by using customer development, startups can systematically test their hypotheses about their target customers, the problem they're trying to solve, and the solution they're offering.

The book outlines a four-step customer development process: customer discovery, customer validation, customer creation, and company building. Each step involves gathering feedback, testing assumptions, and iterating on your MVP. Blank's approach provides a framework for building an MVP that resonates with your target customers.

## 3. Lean Startup by Eric Ries

Lean Startup by Eric Ries is another must-read book for founders. Ries introduces the concept of the MVP and provides a blueprint for how to build and test your MVP quickly and efficiently. The Lean Startup methodology emphasizes experimentation and learning, with a focus on creating a feedback loop that allows you to continually iterate on your product.

The book outlines a series of techniques, such as the Build-Measure-Learn loop and the 5 Whys, that can be used to test assumptions and validate your product. By following the Lean Startup methodology, you can minimize risk and maximize learning, helping you to build an MVP that solves a real problem for your target customers.

The course also covers the Lean Startup methodology and provides guidance on how to build and test an MVP. With a focus on practical application, the Startup Engineering MOOC combines theory and practice, allowing founders to build real-world technical skills that they can apply to their MVP.

## 6. Bubble

Bubble is a no-code platform that allows founders to build fully-functional web and mobile apps without programming knowledge. With Bubble, founders can drag-and-drop pre-built blocks of code to create custom web applications. The platform also provides back-end database functionality, allowing founders to create and manage their MVP's data.

For non-technical founders, Bubble can be a game-changer. The platform provides a low-cost, low-code solution for building an MVP, allowing founders to focus on their product idea rather than the technical aspects of development.

## 7. Figma

Figma is a cloud-based design platform that allows teams to collaborate on designing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX).

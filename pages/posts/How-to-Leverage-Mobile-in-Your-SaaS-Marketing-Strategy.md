# How to Leverage Mobile in Your SaaS Marketing Strategy

For a SaaS (Software as a Service) startup founder, marketing is an essential part of building a successful business. As more and more people use mobile devices to access the internet, it has become essential to leverage mobile in your SaaS marketing strategy. In this article, we will discuss how to do just that.

## The Increasing Importance of Mobile

Mobile usage is on the rise, and it is no secret that people are spending more time on their mobile devices than ever before. According to a report by Statista, mobile devices accounted for 52.2% of all internet traffic in 2018. The shift towards mobile usage is not limited to casual browsing, though. Mobile devices are increasingly being used to access and use SaaS apps.

This surge in mobile usage presents both challenges and opportunities for SaaS startups. On one hand, it means that failing to optimize your marketing strategy for mobile can be a costly mistake. On the other hand, it presents an opportunity for startups to reach new audiences and improve user acquisition rates. Here are some tips on how to leverage mobile in your SaaS marketing strategy:

## Responsive Design

Responsive design is designing your website and any marketing materials in a way that they are optimized for any device screen size. This means that whether a visitor visits your website from a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, your website adjusts to the screen size seamlessly.

Why is responsive design crucial for your SaaS marketing strategy? Let's quickly imagine a scenario where you've created an excellent landing page on your website, but it's not optimized for mobile devices. This means that when a customer accesses your landing page from their smartphone or tablet, the experience is not user-friendly, and they may be likely to leave the page and look for alternatives. This means you've lost out on a potential customer, and your marketing efforts are wasted.

Creating a responsive website not only increases your chances of converting your website visitors into trial or paying customers but also sends the message that you are a professional and credible business.

## Mobile First Design

Mobile-first design is designing your app or website for mobile devices first, then scaling things up to fit desktop environments better. The number of people that browse the internet on mobile devices is increasing every year, making it crucial to design products that perform seamlessly on mobile.

Mobile-first design considers how your customers interact with your product and its interface using the touch screen. This design approach means that the app or website has a clean and simple interface that users can easily navigate, even with one hand. A great mobile-first design not only improves user engagement and retention rates but also helps reduce user churn rates.

Designing a product with a mobile-first mindset takes into account the limitations and capabilities of smaller devices, improving the product's overall user experience. Failing to design with mobile-first in mind could lead to a poor user experience and ultimately hurt your SaaS marketing strategy.

## Mobile Apps

Creating a mobile app for your SaaS can increase your customer's interaction with your product, drive customer loyalty, and ultimately lead to more conversions.

Statistics show that the average person spends three hours and fifteen minutes on their mobile phone daily, so creating a mobile app is a smart and effective way to reach customers. Additionally, most customers prefer an app to a website when dealing with a business, making a mobile app a necessity.

 Mobile apps offer your business many advantages; here are a few:

- Mobile apps reduce friction and make it easier for customers to interact with your product. Unlike using a mobile browser, where users need to remember a URL and log in, a mobile app makes accessing your product more straightforward.
- Mobile apps improve brand loyalty, as they offer a personalized experience for customers that cannot be replicated through a mobile site. Push notifications, for example, allow businesses to communicate directly with their customers.
- Mobile apps provide valuable data about user behavior, which can inform your future product upgrades and marketing decisions.

Creating a mobile app doesn't have to be expensive. If you already have a desktop version, creating a mobile app with the same design, functionality, and features is a good place to start.

## Mobile-optimized Email Marketing Campaigns

Email marketing is still an effective way to reach potential customers, increase engagement, and drive conversions. However, ignoring mobile devices when designing email marketing campaigns is a costly mistake for SaaS businesses.

According to statistics, 81% of people access their email on their mobile devices. If your email campaigns are not optimized for mobile, they run the risk of appearing unprofessional or difficult to read, leading customers to hit the unsubscribe button.

When designing email campaigns for mobile devices, keep the following tips in mind:

- Keep your subject lines and email content brief and to the point.
- Use large, easy to read fonts, as small fonts may be challenging to read on mobile screens.
- Use s short sentence so that the email content will not appear cluttered and make sure you use white space effectively.

## Summary

Leveraging mobile devices in your SaaS marketing strategy is no longer optional. As mobile usage increases, marketing to this audience becomes more and more important.

By creating a responsive website and mobile-first design, creating mobile applications, sending mobile-optimized email marketing campaigns, your business is well on its way to harnessing the power of mobile marketing.

Incorporating mobile into your SaaS marketing strategy doesn't have to be difficult, but it does require focus and dedication. A successfully integrated mobile marketing strategy will help you reach more customers and increase user acquisition, ultimately leading to more sales and growth for your SaaS startup.

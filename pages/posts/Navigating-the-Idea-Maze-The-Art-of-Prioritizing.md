# Navigating the Idea Maze: The Art of Prioritizing

Great ideas are a dime a dozen. Everyone has them. However, turning great ideas into successful products is a totally different ballgame. That's where navigating the idea maze comes in. Navigating the idea maze can be a daunting challenge, but it is necessary if you want to create an MVP and find PMF when creating a startup.

The first step in navigating the idea maze is prioritizing. It is impossible to pursue every idea that comes your way, and it's not just a matter of time and resources. It's important to focus on the ideas that are most likely to bring value to your customers and grow your business. How do you do that? Here are some tips to get you started:

##1. Evaluate your ideas

The first step is to evaluate each idea objectively. The best way to do this is to apply a set of criteria. The criteria could include market size, competitive landscape, customer need, feasibility, and profitability potential. The key is to be unbiased and approach each idea with an open mind.

##2. Prioritize based on customer need

The most important thing to consider is whether the idea meets a real customer need. It's easy to get carried away with fancy features and innovations, but if your product doesn't solve a problem for your customers, it won't be successful. Prioritize ideas that solve a pressing issue for your target market.

##3. Consider feasibility and resources

Ideas that are either impossible to execute or require resources beyond your means should be deprioritized. This doesn’t mean you should immediately dismiss complex ideas, but you should be realistic about your team's capacity to execute on them.

##4. Measure potential profitability

While creating a product solely for profitability isn't a wise approach, potential profitability is certainly an essential part of the decision-making process. Your product needs to have a viable business model to be successful in the long run. At the end of the day, a business that doesn't make a profit isn't sustainable.

##5. Analyze the competition

It’s essential to consider the competition and their products. If the competition already offers a similar product, you can either choose to differentiate yourself and create a unique value proposition, or deprioritize this idea in favor of a more unique product.

##6. Adopt a scalable approach

When prioritizing ideas, it's crucial to select ones that will help your company scale in the long run. Features and ideas that are more scalable will have a greater impact on your business by allowing it to expand more easily and quickly.

##7. Have a clear vision and mission

Every idea you pursue should fit within the context of your company's mission and vision. As you weigh the potential of each idea, consider the extent to which it aligns with your company's overall purpose.

##8. Test your hypothesis

Before moving full speed ahead, always test your hypotheses. Run user research, surveys, and experiment before making investing too much time and resources into a new idea. It's essential to ensure there is demand in the market before diving into production.

##9. Continuously re-evaluate

The prioritizing process is not a one-time event, and decisions can be revisited and changed along the way. Be sure to continuously re-evaluate the ideas you choose to pursue and adjust your roadmap accordingly – especially in feedback-heavy environments like the early stages of a startup.

Navigating the idea maze is a constant effort. Still, these nine tips will help ensure you make decisions that are in line with your company's vision and mission and are based on the potential to bring value to your customers and grow your business. In this ever-changing industry, a prioritizing strategy is essential to ensure the product is kept up to date with innovation and continues to grow in value.

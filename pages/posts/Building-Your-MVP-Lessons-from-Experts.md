# Building Your MVP: Lessons from Experts

As an entrepreneur, building an MVP is a vital step in bringing your startup idea to life. But what exactly is an MVP? An MVP, or Minimum Viable Product, is a basic, stripped down version of your product that allows you to test your idea, gather feedback from customers, and iterate until you find product-market fit (PMF). Building an MVP can be tricky, but luckily, there are plenty of experts out there who have shared their lessons learned. Here are some key takeaways from the experts on building your MVP.

## Start Small, Start Simple

One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make when building their MVP is trying to do too much. It’s natural to want to include every feature and functionality you can think of, but doing so is a recipe for disaster. Instead, start small and keep it simple. Choose one or two key features that are essential to your product and build them out. Focus on delivering value to your customers in the most straightforward and efficient way possible.

As entrepreneur Eric Ries explains, “The goal of a minimum viable product is not to build something to test your hypothesis. The goal is to maximize learning while minimizing the amount of effort expended.” By starting small and focusing on what’s essential, you can better understand what customers care about and what they don’t. Simplify your MVP and iterate until you find PMF.

## Test Early, Test Often

Building an MVP is all about testing, and the best way to do that is to get your product in front of people as early and as often as possible. Gathering feedback from real users will help you understand what’s resonating with your audience and what needs improvement. Don’t be afraid to pivot based on your findings. As entrepreneur and author Steve Blank says, “No business plan survives first contact with customers.”

By testing early and often, you can make informed decisions about what features to build and what to cut. Don’t spend months or years building a product only to find out that no one wants it. Test your idea early and often, and make changes accordingly.

## Prioritize Customer Feedback

Customer feedback is essential to building an MVP that customers love. But it’s not just about gathering feedback; it’s about prioritizing it. As entrepreneur and investor Hiten Shah explains, “The key to building a great MVP is to prioritize customer feedback better than your competition.”

The best way to do this is to create a feedback loop that enables you to gather feedback and implement changes quickly. Incorporating customer feedback into your product development process will not only improve your product but also improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Listen to what your customers are saying, and use that feedback to build a better product.

## Focus on Your Value Proposition

Your MVP should focus on delivering value to your customers. Every feature and functionality should serve your value proposition – the central reason why customers will choose your product over the competition. As entrepreneur and author Ash Maurya explains, “The value proposition statement is the foundation of your business.”

To build an MVP that delivers on your value proposition, stay focused on what’s essential. Cut out any features that don’t directly contribute to your value proposition. This will help you steer clear of “feature creep,” which occurs when too many features are added, diluting the value of the original product.

## Choose the Right Metrics

Measuring the success of your MVP is essential to your product development process. But not all metrics are created equal. It’s crucial to choose the right metrics that will help you understand if you’re moving in the right direction. As Eric Ries explains, “The engine of growth for any product or company is its feedback loop.”

Choose metrics that will help you understand if you’re delivering value to your customers, such as customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction. Use these metrics to test your hypothesis and refine your product until you find PMF.

## Conclusion

Building an MVP is a critical step in bringing your startup idea to life. By starting small and staying focused on what’s essential, incorporating customer feedback, and testing early and often, you can build a product that delivers value to your customers. Use the right metrics to measure your success and refine your product until you find PMF.

Remember, the goal of building an MVP is not to build the perfect product straight away – it’s to maximize learning while minimizing effort. Embrace this mindset, listen to your customers, and iterate until you find PMF. With these key takeaways from the experts, you can build an MVP that sets your startup up for success.
